    <hr size="3" noshade><br> <h2>Study Tips</h2>
    <br>  <p>1. Don’t Cram! It might be tempting to leave all your studying for that big exam up until the last minute, but research suggests that cramming does not improve longer term learning. Students may perform well on a test for which they’ve crammed, but that doesn’t mean they’ve truly learned the material, says an article from the American Psychological Association. Instead of cramming, studies have shown that studying with the goal of long-term retention is best for learning overall.   </p>
          <p>2. Ask for HelpYou don’t have to struggle through difficult material on your own. Many students are not used to seeking help while in high school, but seeking extra support is common in college. As our guide to pursuing a biology major explains, “Be proactive about identifying areas where you need assistance and seek out that assistance immediately. The longer you wait, the more difficult it becomes to catch up.” There are multiple resources to help you, including your professors, tutors, and fellow classmates. Harvard’s Academic Resource Center offers academic coaching, workshops, peer tutoring, and accountability hours for students to keep you on track.  </p>

It should make you think, challenge your assumptions, and push you to explore new perspectives. So why do so many students find school boring? One of the biggest problems with traditional education is that it relies heavily on lectures and memorization.</p>
 <p>Have you ever tried taking notes from a textbook haphazardly without understanding them? This is quite a common scenario among students, especially when you get lost in your thoughts as you write down important notes from your textbook. You may even try to underline or highlight texts without remembering them afterwards. This can be counterproductive</p>
